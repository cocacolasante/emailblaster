"""Endpoint for the one-off 'research a client' tool.

Synchronous flow (the user is waiting in the browser):

1. Parse the LinkedIn URL → derive a slug + name guess.
2. Single Anthropic call with web_search to extract identity +
   personalization signals (mode controls depth).
3. Single Anthropic call to compose the outreach message with a strict
   per-message character limit.

No DB writes — research and compose are returned to the user to copy
into LinkedIn / email manually.  Adding a saved-history table would be
a separate feature; out of scope here.
